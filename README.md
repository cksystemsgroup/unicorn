***Symbolic Execution, Bounded Model Checking, and Code Optimization of RISC-V Code using Classical Solvers and Quantum Computers***

Unicorn compiles 64-bit RISC-V ELF binaries via finite state machines over the theory of bitvectors and arrays of bitvectors to SMT and SAT formulae as well as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) models and quantum circuits (QCs) that are all logically equivalent. Satisfiability of the SMT and SAT formulae generated by Unicorn can be checked using standard SMT and SAT solvers, respectively. QUBO models are generated by a component of Unicorn called QUBOT and target quantum annealers. QCs are generated by another component of Unicorn called QUARC and target gate-model quantum computers.

Unicorn models RISC-V code execution with a bit-precise finite state machine over all RISC-V machine states using 64-bit bitvectors, one for each general-purpose 64-bit CPU register, 1-bit bitvectors, one for each possible program counter value, and an array of 64-bit bitvectors modeling 64-bit main memory.

Unicorn constructs the finite state machine such that a state `S` is reachable from the initial state in `n` state transitions if and only if there is input to the RISC-V code that makes a RISC-V machine reach the machine state modeled by `S` after executing the RISC-V code for no more than `n` instructions.

Unicorn outputs the finite state machine for a given state `S` either as QUBO model, that is, as objective function of a quantum annealer for a given bound on `n`, or as quantum circuit for a gate-model quantum computer. The output of a quantum machine is an input to the RISC-V code for reaching `S` during execution, if there is such input, resembling what a symbolic execution engine or bounded model checker for RISC-V would do.

Unicorn reports the size of QUBO models and quantum circuits in number of quantum bits. QUBO models grow linearly in `n` (quadratically in `n` if the RISC-V code's memory consumption is unbounded). Quantum circuits grow linearly in code size (or memory usage if the RISC-V code's memory consumption is unbounded).

Unicorn optimizes size by applying SMT and SAT solvers during compilation. Whenever a quantum bit can be shown to represent a constant value for all inputs, the bit is replaced with that value. Given a time budget `T`, Unicorn attempts to find solutions for all quantum bits within `T`. Only if Unicorn runs out of time, involving a quantum machine makes sense yet only as long as the number `u` of undetermined quantum bits is less than the number `a` of quantum bits available on the machine. We call `a-u` the quantum advantage with time budget `T`.

Unicorn supports the base 64-bit RISC-V instruction set with some extensions (specifically `rv64im` at the moment), and five system calls (`exit`, `brk`, `openat`, `read`, `write`). RISC-V code gets input through the `read` system call. We plan to support more RISC-V extensions and more system calls eventually.

## Building Unicorn

Unicorn is written in Rust and uses standard tools from the Rust toolchain whenever possible. The following steps will guide you through the process of building Unicorn on your machine from scratch.

1. Install and bootstrap Rust: We recommend to use [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) for this because it is easiest to use, works on most systems, and helps to keep your toolchain up-to-date. Unicorn is tested against Rust v1.72.0 (or higher) and supports any of the following targets, just pick the appropriate one during bootstrapping:
   - x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
   - x86_64-apple-darwin
   - x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

   Follow the instructions from `rustup` and make sure the toolchain is added to your path. This should also install `rustfmt` (the source formatter) and `clippy` (the linter) which are needed when contributing changes. In case these components are missing, they can be added as follows:
   ```sh
   $ rustup component add rustfmt
   $ rustup component add clippy
   ```

1. Compile Unicorn: To compile everything, simply use `cargo`, the Rust build system and package manager. The following will compile Unicorn in debug mode with all dependencies locked to specific versions that are tested and known to work.
   ```sh
   $ cargo build --locked
   ```
   By default we are not building any SMT solvers (to reduce build time). To include SMT solvers in the build process you can enable them as a feature. Note that `boolector` is not supported on Windows. The following additional Cargo flags are helpful to know about:
   - `--release`: Build a release binary (for performance) instead of a debug binary.
   - `--features=z3`: Enable support for `z3` (or `boolector`, or both) during the build process.
   - `--all-features`: Enable all optional features (i.e. all SMT solvers).

1. Run test suite (optional): Unicorn comes with several unit-tests as well as integration-tests that can all be run via Cargo as well. The following will run all of them, again in debug mode with locked dependencies.
   ```sh
   $ cargo test --locked
   ```

## Using Unicorn

First, generate a RISC-V binary with [Selfie](https://github.com/cksystemsteaching/selfie) using the command below:

```sh
selfie -c <SOURCE_CODE_FILE> -o <BINARY_FILE>
```

To display the available subcommands that Unicorn has you can type `./target/debug/unicorn --help`, or to display subcommand options `./target/debug/unicorn <SUBCOMMAND> --help`.

Currently, there are 3 main commands:
### 1. Generate a BTOR2 file from a binary
```sh
./target/debug/unicorn beator <BINARY_FILE> --unroll <NUM_STATE_TRANSITIONS> --solver boolector --out <BTOR2_FILE>
```
The above command generates a BTOR2 file, while the unroll option specifies how many state transitions Unicorn should represent in the BTOR2 file. In this example, Unicorn optimizes the number of variables using Boolector. 

There are more options. For example, you can add `--bitblast` to the command, and the BTOR2 file will represent a logic (combinatorial) circuit.


### 2. Generate and/or test a QUBO of the binary
```sh
./target/debug/unicorn qubot <BINARY_FILE> --unroll <NUM_STATE_TRANSITIONS> --solver <SMT_SOLVER> --out <QUBO_FILE> --inputs 42,32;34
```
This command dumps a QUBO model in `<QUBO_FILE>`, however passing `--out` is optional.

The `--inputs` parameter is also optional. In this example, we are assuming our model consumes two inputs. Therefore, we are first testing our model with inputs 42 and 32, and then 34 (the first value of each test is replicated to satisfy the number of inputs the model consumes if there are not enough values). 

In this example, Unicorn prints one line for each test in the terminal:

```sh
offset:2, bad states count:0
offset:0, bad states count:1
```

For the first test, our model does not reach a ground state, therefore no bad state happens. However, the second line tells us that input 32 makes one bad state reachable.

The QUBO file has five sections, each section is separated by an empty line, and each line separates values by a space. The file is described as follows:

1. The first section consists of a single line, and it contains two numbers: the number of variables and the offset of the QUBO. 
2. The second section contains lines mapping input-nids of the corresponding BTOR2 file to unique identifiers of qubits, and whether or not our optimization techniques found some value for each of the qubits. IDs of qubits are separated by commas (LSB comes first), and `-` means that the SMT/SAT solvers have not determined a value for these qubits.
3. The third section is similar to the previous one, but instead, it maps bad-state-nids to qubits ids. Bad states are booleans, therefore only one qubit-id is needed.
4. The fourth section describes linear coefficients and follows the format `<qubit-id> <linear-coeff>`.
5. The last section describes quadratic (bilinear) coefficients and follows the format `<qubit-id> <qubit-id> <quadratic-coeff>`.

Here you can see an example of what the file might look like:

```
548 1023

10000001 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 -,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

10000148 13 0
10000148 14 -

9 2
10 0
11 0
12 4
...

1 9 4
3 9 6
...
```
### 3. Execute a QUBO file on real quantum hardware
Right now, we are wrapping Python functions to access real hardware, and the implementation of embedding algorithm and a REST framework is still on its way.

To execute on real quantum hardware, first, refer to this [setup guide](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/latest/overview/install.html#set-up-your-environment).

The command below performs `<NUM_RUNS>` samples on the quantum annealer, while the physical qubits will have an absolute coupling value of `CHAIN_STRENGTH`.

```sh
./target/debug/unicorn dwave <QUBO_FILE> --num-runs <NUM_RUNS> --chain-strength <CHAIN_STRENGTH>
```

Running this command will output on the terminal: 

1. The minimum energy (final offset of the QUBO) that the annealer found among all runs.
2. One line for each input nid that the model has. Unicorn displays for each input a nid, a value in decimal, and a value in binary (MSB).
3. The nids of the bad states that occur (qubits whose value are 1).

Below is an example of a small QUBO file representing an AND gate, and the output for such file:

```
3 0

1 1,2 -,-

bad 3 -

3 6

1 2 2
1 3 -4
2 3 -4
```

``` sh
Py(0x10cdd90d0)
{'path': 'and.unicorn', 'num_reads': '10', 'chain_strength': '1'}
final offset:  0.0

input:  1 2.0 10

True bad states nids
no bad states occur
```
