The purpose of this code is to demonstrate the capabilities
of the monster model generator of selfie. Monster translates
the code to an SMT-LIB or BTOR2 formula that is satisfiable
if and only if the code exits with a non-zero exit code, or
performs division by zero or invalid/unsafe memory accesses.
